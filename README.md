# Undergraduate-Thesis
This repository was reated for (mostly jupyter notebooks) concerning my thesis for my undergraduate diploma in physics, supervised by prof. Anastasios Petkou. The general subject of my thesis is Quantum Mechanics with an interest in the measurement problem. More specifically i concern myself with the mathematical formulation end solutions to Open quantum systems dynamics. Here I utillise python library ```qutip``` and numerical methods to solve a system of Harmonic oscillators.
